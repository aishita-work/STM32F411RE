# STM32F411RE Projects — Bare-Metal Embedded Systems

This repository contains my STM32F411RE projects developed while completing the **Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up™ (STM32)** course.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course focuses on **bare-metal firmware development** for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers using STM32 boards. The main objective is to build embedded systems from scratch by directly interacting with hardware registers without relying on external libraries such as HAL or third-party drivers.

The course provides a deep understanding of how microcontrollers work internally and teaches professional embedded firmware development practices used in industry.

## 🎯 What I Learned

* Bare-metal programming using Embedded C (no external libraries)
* ARM Cortex-M microcontroller architecture
* Register-level programming and memory-mapped peripherals
* Reading and understanding microcontroller datasheets and reference manuals
* CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard)
* Firmware debugging techniques

## ⚙️ Peripheral Driver Development

The course covers building drivers from scratch for:

* GPIO (General Purpose Input Output)
* ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)
* UART communication
* Timers and PWM generation
* Interrupt handling (NVIC)
* SPI communication
* I2C communication
* DMA (Direct Memory Access)
* System Tick timer (SysTick)

## 🛠 Key Concepts Practiced

* Defining peripheral memory addresses
* Creating register structures from hardware documentation
* Bit-level register configuration
* Hardware abstraction through driver design
* Debugging embedded firmware
* Understanding the relationship between hardware and software

**Microcontroller:** STM32F411RE (ARM Cortex-M4)
