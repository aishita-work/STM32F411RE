# LED Toggle Using Register Address Structure

## Overview

This project demonstrates LED toggling on STM32F411RE using direct register access through C structures. It introduces memory-mapped peripheral addressing and register-level programming.

## Key Concepts

* Memory mapped I/O
* Peripheral base address mapping
* Creating register structures
* Direct register manipulation
* GPIO configuration without HAL

## Learning Outcome

Understanding how microcontroller registers are accessed and controlled using structure-based register mapping.
